# 🧬 Nyx Dynamics

**Quantum · Geometry · Resilience**

Welcome to the official GitHub for **Nyx Dynamics** — a research initiative focused on the intersection of quantum biology, spatial computation, and systems neuroscience. We develop theoretical and computational models that explore how geometric structures preserve information in complex biological systems.

## 🎯 Mission

At Nyx Dynamics, we investigate:

- Quantum coherence in biological environments  
- Nonuniform geometries (e.g., Fibonacci scaling) as protective mechanisms  
- Resilience of microtubular systems under inflammatory stress  
- Phase-specific coherence preservation in neuroimmune contexts (e.g., HAND, HIV, fever)
