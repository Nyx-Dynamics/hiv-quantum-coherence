## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Security Contact
- **Primary Contact**: pivot1973@yahoo.com
- **Backup Contact**: dr.a.c.demidongt@gmail.com
- **PGP Key**: []

### Reporting Process
1. **DO NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities
2. Email security details to our security contact
3. Include the following information:
   - Detailed description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested fixes (if any)

### Response Timeline
- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Severity Assessment**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Development**: 30-90 days (depending on complexity)
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is released and users have time to update

### Vulnerability Categories

#### Critical Severity
- Remote code execution
- Data corruption in quantum simulations
- Unauthorized access to research data
- Cryptographic vulnerabilities

#### High Severity
- Local privilege escalation
- Significant performance degradation
- Memory safety issues
- Authentication bypasses

#### Medium/Low Severity
- Information disclosure
- Denial of service
- Configuration issues

## Research Data Security

### Sensitive Information
This project may handle:
- Computational models related to HIV research
- Quantum circuit designs
- Performance benchmarks
- Research collaboration data

### Data Handling Guidelines
- **No patient data** should ever be committed to this repository
- **Synthetic datasets only** for testing and validation
- **Anonymized research results** where applicable
- **Secure external storage** for sensitive research data

## Quantum Computing Security Considerations

### Algorithm Security
- Regular review of quantum circuit implementations
- Validation of quantum random number generation
- Protection against quantum algorithm manipulation

### Classical-Quantum Interface
- Secure communication between classical and quantum components
- Input validation for quantum circuit parameters
- Protection against timing attacks on quantum operations

## Responsible Disclosure

We are committed to working with security researchers and the scientific community to address vulnerabilities responsibly. We ask that you:

1. Give us reasonable time to address issues before public disclosure
2. Avoid accessing or modifying data that doesn't belong to you
3. Don't perform attacks that could harm system availability
4. Respect the scientific integrity of ongoing research

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Code Contributions
- Follow secure coding practices
- Use dependency scanning tools
- Implement proper input validation
- Document security-relevant design decisions

### Research Data
- Never commit sensitive research data
- Use environment variables for external service credentials
- Implement proper access controls for data files
- Regular backup and integrity checking

## Bug Bounty Program

Currently, we do not offer a formal bug bounty program. However, we do provide:
- Public acknowledgment (with permission)
- Collaboration opportunities for significant discoveries
- Research credit in publications where applicable

## Security Updates

Security updates will be communicated through:
- GitHub Security Advisories
- Release notes with security sections
- Direct notification to known users/collaborators
- Research community mailing lists (where appropriate)

## Contact Information

For non-security related issues, please use our standard GitHub issue tracker.

For urgent security matters requiring immediate attention, contact: [acdemidont@nycdynamics.ai]
